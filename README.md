# Coding Challenge

This contains coding challenges that I have attempted in the past. Each folder represents a
challenge and is a self-contained
project. For more details about each challenge, see the details within that folder
All of the challenges in this repository are done in .NET Core with C#.

I provide details on why I created this repository and how this repository can benefit others who 
are learning how to code regardless of the language that they learning on my website.
